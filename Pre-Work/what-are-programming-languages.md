# What are Programming Languages?

Before we can ask computers to do work for us, we need to learn to speak a language that it understands - a programming language. A <strong>programming language</strong> is a lot like a human language.

Each programming language has specific syntax and semantics. The same way human languages have their own rules for things like nouns, verbs and adjectives, programming languages often have their own rules for common programming concepts like "variables", "functions", and "expressions".

Likewise, some languages have a lot in common; others are very different from each other. For example, if you know Spanish, you'll probably have an easier time learning a related language like Italian or Portuguese, than a language from another part of the globe, like Japanese or Korean. Likewise, if you know JavaScript, you'll probably have an easier time learning the languages that it's related to, like Java or C, than a less-related language like Lisp.

A programming language is different from human languages though. In a programming language, you must be exact. You can still understand someone in a human language if there are misspellings, missing words, or words out of place. If I say, "Can go store you?", there's a good chance you still interpreted that as a request to go to the store. However, a computer isn't as intuitive as humans are. A missing letter or misplaced space can be the difference between a working program, and a broken program.

This is why it's important to remember our programming virtue of attention to detail.
