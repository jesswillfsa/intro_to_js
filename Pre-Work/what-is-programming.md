# What is Programming?

At this point, we've become familiar with two of the three fundamental front-end technologies - HTML and CSS. HTML and CSS describe the way a document should look - the decisions you make are not very different from the ones you make when using a word processor. However, once we start to learn about JavaScript, we'll need to make different kinds of decisions - these types of decisions bring us into the world of programming.

But what exactly is programming, and how is it different from text presentation with HTML and CSS?

- For one, programming is often concerned with transforming input into output. If writing HTML and CSS is like using a word processor, then writing JavaScript is like using a calculator. You enter some input, then run (or "execute") your program, and expect to receive some kind of calculated output on the other end.

- Another difference is that programming often involves logical analysis and decision-making. We may write code that instructs the computer to behave one way if a certain condition is true, and another way if not. In this way, programming could be similar to some actions you can take in a spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel or Google Docs. You might make it so that if the value in a cell is above a certain threshold, it will be colored green, and if it's below that threshold, it will be colored red.

- Finally, programming often involves repetition. We may write code that instructs the computer to perform the same task a certain number of times, or until a certain condition is met.

However, being a programmer isn't just about giving instructions to a computer. An important thing to keep in mind when writing any code is that you're also writing for humans, either by writing clear, conventional code, or through documentation. That is, programming is a social activity. Professional programmers don't just write code for themselves - they write code so that they can collaborate on that code with others.

<strong>Programming is also a creative process</strong>, similar to writing an essay, story or poem in English. We outline our ideas, make a first draft, get critique, make a second draft, and repeat until ready. But even when we're "done", we may still revisit and revise our code later if we discover problems (called "bugs"), or if we come up with new ideas to make it better.

So, while popular culture often portrays programming as a fairly robotic thing, it's actually a wonderful, rich medium for expressing ideas, just like many other artistic media. I hope that you'll find lots of joy in learning to express yourself through the language of programs!
